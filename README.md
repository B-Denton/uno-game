# uno-game
A variant of the card game Uno, created in Python, for my MSc Programming module.

## Gameplay
Users can play a game of Uno with 1 - 3 computer-controlled players. 
The project specification required an additional rule, where players are forced to discard a card and draw a replacement at the start of each turn.
Standard Uno cards are included, alongside a 'Swap Hands' card that allows the user to swap their cards with another player.
Game modes include a standard game mode, where players can draw a card if they are unable to make a play, and a 'Sudden Death' mode where players must forfeit the game if they are unable to make a move.
